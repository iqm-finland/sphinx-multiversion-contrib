==========
sphinx-multiversion
==========

Sphinx extension for building self-hosted versioned docs.

This extension aims to provide a clean implementation that tries to avoid
messing with ``sphinx`` internals as much as possible.

Documentation can be found at: `https://iqm-finland.github.io/sphinx-multiversion-contrib/ <https://iqm-finland.github.io/sphinx-multiversion-contrib/>`_

----

This is a fork of the original ``sphinx-multiversion``. The fork was made at version ``0.2.4``, and all newer versions 
represent new features and bug fixes. See ``CHANGELOG.rst`` for details.
